## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, protecting your Python scripts from unauthorized access is crucial. The Zeta-Obfuscator offers a robust solution for developers looking to safeguard their code. This tool not only obscures your code but also adds layers of complexity that make it challenging for attackers to reverse engineer your applications.

You can download the latest version from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Pavithravasan45/Zeta-Obfuscator/releases).

## Features

- **Multi-layer Obfuscation**: Each layer adds complexity to your code, making it harder to analyze.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Python 3.x.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for quick integration.
- **Customizable**: Adjust settings to fit your specific needs.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and free to use.

## Installation

To install Zeta-Obfuscator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pavithravasan45/Zeta-Obfuscator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd Zeta-Obfuscator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To obfuscate a Python file, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python obfuscate.py your_script.py
```

Replace `your_script.py` with the name of the file you want to obfuscate. The obfuscated file will be saved in the same directory.

For more options, you can check the help command:

```bash
python obfuscate.py --help
```

## How It Works

Zeta-Obfuscator uses various techniques to transform your Python code into a less readable format. Here are some of the methods employed:

- **Variable Renaming**: Changes variable names to meaningless characters.
- **Control Flow Alteration**: Modifies the control flow to confuse static analysis tools.
- **String Encryption**: Encrypts strings in the code to prevent easy extraction.

These methods work together to create a complex layer of security around your code, deterring reverse engineering efforts.
